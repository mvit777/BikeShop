# blazorBikeShopClient
A thrown away blazor wasml client for bikeDistributor library

This is actually my first try at building an wasml blazor app. 
I was a bit skeptical at start, I expected a similar experience as building webapp with old days webforms. 
In fact the programming model is very much the same but a lot smoother. 
You get a strong Déjà vu  feeling and start thinking that "...how webforms should have been back in the days..."

Blazor is very young and I don't think it has a very large pool of potential users besides those developers 
who are not in love with javascript.

As far as I tested (which is not much) I noticed:
- project folder structure is clear and very customisable
- routing is a breeze. You just assign url directly in the blazor partial
- templating and site wire-framing is truly quick
- services registration and DI are very similar to an aspnetcoreMVC project but a more messy

(...more to come...)
